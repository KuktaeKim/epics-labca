<h1>LabCA - EPICS/Channel Access Interface for Scilab and Matlab</h1>
<address>
  Till Straumann &lt;strauman/at/slac.stanford.edu&gt;, 2002-2015. Last

<p>Here comes yet another CA interface. This one builds on top of a modified
(thread-safe) version of <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/ezca/index.php">libezca</a>. This
modified version comes with labCA.</p>

<h3>Changes<br>
</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>2018/03/04:</dt>
	<dd><p><a
      href="labca_3_7_2.tgz">labCA
      3.7.2</a> released. This works around matlab 2017b crashing during
      initialization of labCA. 
	</p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> This is a bugfix release, replacing 3.7.1 which has been
      retired (the tarball was incomplete, sorry). 3.7.2 also addresses issues
      in a windows environment without bash and other common unix tools.
    </p>
    </dd>
  <dt>2017/08/08:</dt>
	<dd><p><a
      href="labca_3_5_1.tgz">labCA
      3.5.1</a> released. lcaGet of DBF_LONG in native format resulted in an
      intermediate conversion to float and loss of precision (thanks to
      J. Vasquez for reporting). 
	</p>
    <p>
      To work around this bug it is possible to request such values explicity
      as DBF_DOUBLE (see lcaGet documentation).
    </p>

    </dd>
  <dt>2015/09/08:</dt>
	<dd><p><a
      href="labca_3_5_0.tgz">labCA
      3.5.0</a> released. A few minor fixes to build under base-3.15 (thanks
	  to S. Gierman for reporting).
	</p>

	<p>Also, there is now a new call:
	<ul>
	<li>
	  'lcaGetEnumStrings' which allows you to
	  retrieve the possible values of an enum-type PV.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	</dd>
  <dt>2015/03/12:</dt>
	<dd><a
      href="labca_3_4_2.tgz">labCA
      3.4.2</a> released. A few minor fixes required to build under matlab 2014a.
      Thanks to Matthew Furseman for contributing the respective patch.
	</dd>
  <dt>2013/06/25:</dt>
	<dd><a
      href="labca_3_4_1.tgz">labCA
      3.4.1</a> released. Still no new code. Just a bugfix in the build system
      which only affects builds for scilab under windows. Thanks to Takashi
      Obina for reporting and suggesting a fix.
	</dd>
  <dt>2012/01/17:</dt>
    <dd><a
      href="labca_3_4.tgz">labCA
      3.4</a> released. This release contains no new code or bugfixes (I
      haven't received any reports since 3.3) but addresses the build system,
      mostly under windows. It should now be possible to build labCA under a
      non-cygwin (i.e., plain 'command.com') environment. Note that blanks in
      paths still cause grief. It's best to avoid them; for work-arounds
      consult the respective <a
      href="README.win32pathswithblanks">README</a>
      in the distribution.</dd>
    <dd>Tested under windows-64bit.</dd>
  <dt>2010/06/07:</dt>
    <dd><a
      href="labca_3_3.tgz">labCA
      3.3</a> released. This release implements a few minor improvements:
      <ul>
        <li>lcaGetUnits(), lcaGet_xxx_Limits(), lcaGetPrecision() and
          lcaGetStatus() no longer transfer the full element count of an array.
          This speeds up these calls when working with a slow connection and it
          leaves these calls unaffected by EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES.</li>
        <li>added support for scilab-5</li>
        <li>added help files for scilab-5.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>3.3. also contains the additions already present in 3.2_beta, of
      course (there never was a 3.2 release):</p>
    </dd>
    <dd><ul>
        <li>Added entry points to read warning- and alarm-limits:
          lcaGetWarnLimits(), lcaGetAlarmLimits().</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a <em>source-only</em> release, sorry.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>2007/11/14:</dt>
    <dd>Jim Sebek contributed a <a
      href="epicsInstall31482.pdf">document
      addressing problems and work-arounds</a> for building EPICS-3.14.8.2 and
      LABCA-3.1 on the WIN32 VISTA platform.</dd>
  <dt>2007/10/13:</dt>
    <dd>labca-3.1 released. This is a bugfix release. Greg Portmann discovered
      a memory leak in 'lcaGetNoWait()'. If you frequently use this routine
      then you should upgrade. 3.1 also plugs memory leaks in the scilab
      interface but these are less critical (memory is only leaked in some
      cases where errors are reported but not during error-free operation). 
      <p>Note that for the moment 3.1 is a source-code only release. I didn't
      have time to build and thoroughly test on all platforms, sorry. However,
      I believe it is desirable to get the fix out there...</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>2007/6/11:</dt>
    <dd>labca-3.0.beta released. This is a 'new feature' release: 
      <ul>
        <li>labca no longer pends for CA activity in multiples of the labca
          timeout value. We now make full use of multi-threaded CA and return
          as soon as a labca command completes.</li>
        <li>added 'lcaNewMonitorWait()' call which blocks execution until all
          requested monitors have new data (or a timeout expires).</li>
        <li>more consistent and informative error handling. All errors now can
          be handled with the '<tt>try-catch-end</tt>' and '<tt>lasterror</tt>'
          commands.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    <dd>more details can be found in the ChangeLog file.</dd>
  <dt>2007/6/11:</dt>
    <dd>labca-2.1 released. This is a bugfix release: 
      <ul>
        <li>lcaPutNoWait() didn't flush CA queue.</li>
        <li>use mexLock() to prevent labca from being unloaded from memory
          (matlab 'clear all' would crash).</li>
        <li>64-bit portability fix</li>
        <li>scilab got stuck during initialization in non-windowing mode.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  <dt>2006/4/18:</dt>
    <dd>labca-2.1.beta released: 
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-style: italic;">PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings
          have slightly changed</span> (see below and/or manual). <span
          style="font-style: italic;">Update your startup scripts etc.
          accordingly</span>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Ctrl-C handling should now be more stable and more portable.
          Platform-specific hacks have been abandoned in favor of (alas
          undocumented) hooks into matlab and scilab that poll for a pending
          Ctrl-C keypress.<br>
          <span style="font-style: italic;">Older versions of labca don't work
          correctly with matlab-7.2 on win32</span>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a problem with monitors that occurred when an IOC was
          rebooted.</li>
        <li>Consult 'ChangeLog' for more details.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>2004/6/23:</dt>
    <dd>labca-2.0.alpha released. The following new features were added: 
      <ul>
        <li>lcaClear() allows you to clear/disconnect channels. Unconnected
          channels are automatically cleared to avoid annoying messages by 3.14
          background threads. Adding this feature involved some additions to
          EZCA and therefore the version number was changed.</li>
        <li>lcaSetMonitor() and lcaNewMonitorValue() were added (providing EZCA
          monitor functionality). Monitors are especially handy with EPICS 3.14
          since data is automatically retrieved by background threads.
          matlab/scilab can process in the foreground while waiting for
          monitored data to change. Labca can be polled for new data with the
          lcaNewMonitorValue() call.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Download a binary release (including EPICS-3.14.5/CA binaries) and get
      going immediately.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>2004/4/2:</dt>
    <dd>labca-1.5.beta released. 
      <p>This release enables standard error handling in matlab. Prior releases
      didn't throw errors because this would abort matlab7 on linux. The cause
      for this has now been discovered and is described in the ReleaseNotes.</p>
      <p>The tarball ships binaries for win32-x86, linux-x86 and solaris-sparc.
      It includes all required CA client libraries (EPICS-3.14.5).</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>2004/2/25:</dt>
    <dd>labca-1.4.beta released; this release adds a matlab implementation to
      'lcaGetStatus'. No other changes.</dd>
