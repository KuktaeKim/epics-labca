Changes since labca_1_5pre_beta (T.S):
	- set shared library version numbers in anticipation of future
      releases.
Changes since labca_1_4_beta (T.S):
	- Have the matlab version call 'errMsgTxt()' on error to 
      trigger the standard way of error flagging. I finally
      found the reason for the linux crashes ;-)
    - Implemented a workaround in ezErr() -- Scilab's mexPrintf()
      [i.e. sciprint] crashed when munging long strings (multi-line
      errors). We now break those messages up in smaller chunks...
    - multi_ezca_put() now returns a value to indicate error status
      (rval == number of successfully written PVs, -1 on error).
Changes since labca_1_3_beta:
	2004/2/20: T.S added matlab implementation of lcaGetStatus()
	2004/2/20: T.S added this ChangeLog
